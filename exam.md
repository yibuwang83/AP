# Frontend Take Home Exercise

## Simulation Log Viewer

    nuTonomy runs simulations of different car builds in different scenarios. Even if the car build and scenario match, the results can differ. Your task is to create a web interface that presents the scenario logs and performs basic operations.

## Requirements

1.  Every scenario has an id and a maximum number of "stops" (times when the car unexpectedly braked).

2.  Every simulation run has a start time, end time, car build and a corresponding scenario. A run is considered successful if

- It does not exceed the maximum number of stops for the scenario
- It does not exceed the maximum running time for the scenario. (Calculated by <end_time> - <start_time>)
- It does not have a collision

`A set of logs has the following format:`

```json
{
    "simulationRuns": [
        {
            "startTime": number (UTC timestamp),
            "endTime": number (UTC timestamp),
            "scenarioId": string,
            "carBuild": string,
            "result": {
                "numberOfStops": number,
                "hasCollision": boolean,
            }
        }
    ],
    "scenarios": [
        {
            "scenarioId": string,
            "maxNumberOfStops": number,
            "maxRunningTime": number,
        }
    ]
}
```

## Interface

The data should be presented as a table of simulation runs with the following format:

| scenarioId | carBuild | startTime | runningTime / maxRunningTime | numberOfStops / maxNumberOfStops | hasCollision | doesScenarioPass |

Each run should be sortable on every column e.g. ascending order of startTime or descending numberOfStops.

The data should be filterable by

- scenarioId
- carBuild
- scenarioId and carBuild

Selecting any filter should show the relevant runs and present the following statistics

- percentage of runs that exceed the maximum number of stops
- percentage of runs that exceed the maximum running time
- percentage of runs that have a collision
- percentage of runs that do not pass

## Technical requirements

- Project should be installable and runnable with npm i.e. npm install && npm start
- Project should be testable with npm test
- Project must be written using a modern JavaScript framework e.g. Angular, React, etc

- The interface should be clean. Advanced HTML/CSS is not a priority
